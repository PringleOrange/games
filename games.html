  <header>Astrospace</header>
    <div class="navsec" style="height: 500px;">
  <nav>Astrospace is a 2D space game where your goal is to shoot enemies and survive as long as possible.</nav>
  <section>
    
    <h1>Astrospace has a kills and score system. If you go below 0 score (You lose 1 score each bullet you fire and gain 3 score for every kill you get) then you die.
    Furthermore, every fifty kills there is a boss you must take down. Use W, A and S to move and Q, E to fire bullets.</h1>

  <header>Cookie Clicker (B-Game edition)</header>
    <div class="navsec" style="height: 500px;">
  <nav>This is a very basic cookie clicker game made in 38 minutes. The purpose of making this was to see how fast I could make it.</nav>
  <section>
    
    <h1>This is the version of cookie clicker which I put basically no time into. It won't be as fun as the new full game of it I've made but 
      you may find it interesting to see what I did in that time.</h1>

  <header>Cookie Clicker 2 (Full game)</header>
    <div class="navsec" style="height: 500px;">
  <nav>I didn't spend much longer making this game than the B game but quite a few hours still went into it.</nav>
  <section>
    
    <h1>This is the better version of the B-Game cookie clicker which was the original. Whilst it still may not be that fun, it has quite a few
    more features now than it did before.</h1>
